*Use computer microphone to plot pitch of speech and compare to Google Translate audio as real-time instructional feedback* 

+ Side project from late 2020
+ `googletrans` translator Python API started having issues around this time. It used to be easy to fetch automatic translations, and it would be fun to use this with dynamic user inputs, but until we can reliably use this or an equivalent for translation it will be hard 

**TO-DO:**
+ Wrap in a front-end (currently trying to learn some Flask) 
+ Normalize time axis of plots to correct for differences in speech 
+ Explore ways to improve the pitch detection algorithm linguistically - are there features other than pitch that matter in tone/meaning perception?
+ Fill out this readme
